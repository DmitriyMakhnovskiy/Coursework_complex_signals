This college coursework delves into various aspects of complex signal analysis. For detailed information, please consult the attached report "Solutions for coursework_CITY 1081.pdf". The calculations were conducted using Python (main.py) and LTspice simulator (in a separate folder), showcasing practical applications of numerical methods and techniques employed in signal analysis.

We have also included slide presentations on these topics, saved as the Power Point Show files (PPSX folder), to serve as supplementary teaching resources.

The short video "Experimental Rig for the Ultrasonic Network.mp4" showcases a simple experimental setup designed to investigate transfer functions in linear networks.
